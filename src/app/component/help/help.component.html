      </b> <br> <br>For decades Save the Children has been working with the most disadvantaged children to provide them better healthcare, education opportunities and protection from physical and mental exploitation. In India, we go right in the middle of the poorest communities with our development projects and help children be children. We rid them from the clutches of malnutrition, send them to schools, help pregnant women deliver safe, pull children out of child labour – all with an aim to give children a happy childhood. 

     <br>  It is because of the hundreds and thousands of generous donors that we have been able to pull it so far. We need your continued support to enable us to continue with our work with the same vigour and passion.
